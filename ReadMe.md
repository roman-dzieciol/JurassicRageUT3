Jurassic Rage mutator turns hunters into the hunted. Packs of hungry dinosaurs roam the battlefield,
 looking for anything they can gnaw on. Whatever are your objectives, stay sharp soldier!

Tips: 
 * To install on Windows, extract the .zip file to your "My Documents\My Games\Unreal Tournament 3\" folder.
 * To play, open the mutator settings menu when starting game and pick one or more Jurassic Rage mutators.
 * You can configure the dinosaurs using the standard mutator configuration button.
 * The T-Rex mutator works best on large maps with vehicles, such as WAR-Torlan.
 * Warning: Mixing those mutators with other mods may result in tons of extra fun and uncontrollable laughter! 
 
Enjoy!
